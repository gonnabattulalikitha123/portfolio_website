              <p>I am a  Developer and a website designer who loves to create innovative designs and i have designed my first project in my btech 2nd year.The project is a <b>Telegram chatbot</b> which fetches movie information  which i loved the most in my works.
              <br> I'm a 2nd year student studying bachelor of technology at Vishnu institute of technology. With a keen interest in smart technologies, I'm dedicated to my passion and will try to work hard and smart for achieving my dreams.

              And the projects that i did are very simplistic but innovatively inspired.i love what i do,and adore the creative process;it is addictive and can give never ending possibilities.
              I am very webaddicted and i attended an event in my college which is a web hackathon where i got so much addicted to these things.Any new project that comes in my mind  that i am lifting off the ground or exhibiting new work.i enjoy getting to create and spend time on my projects.
